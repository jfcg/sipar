## Single Page Robot (SiPaR)
When my five year-old daughter asked me to build a robot with her, I realized I did not have a good template. Later I also realized printing paper is easier to work with than cardboard or wood for such a quick project. I set out to design a template that'll fit on an A4 paper, and the result exceeded I and my dauhghter's expectations. I thought other people should also benefit from my design which I developed with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) v24.8 Draw.

Enter, Single Page Robot, aka. SiPaR! You can build a whole 3d robot / doll that is 20 cm tall and has 16.5 cm arm span. All you need is:
- print a single page from your printer
- draw / paint your doll / robot
- cut along solid lines
- fold at dashed lines
- glue front, back & all

It is a great way to have fun with kids. So here are the designs for [A4 paper](./Single-Page-Robot-A4.pdf) and [Letter paper](./Single-Page-Robot-Letter.pdf) sizes.

Enjoy :robot: :dolls: :)
